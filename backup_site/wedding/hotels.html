  <h1>Hotels</h1>
  <div>We're recommending that guests stay in Fishkill, NY. We will have shuttles from that town to the wedding in Ancramdale.</div>
  <br />
  <b style="color: red">NOTE: Hotels in the area are filling up quickly due to graduations and a horse show going on the same weekend. Book as soon as possible.</b>
  <h3>Recommended hotels:</h3>
  <div>
    <div>We have negotiated a special rate with two hotels in town:</div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <b>Fishkill Courtyard</b>
      <ul>
        <li>We have rooms blocked at a discounted rate for Friday, unforunately they can't give us more discounted rooms for Saturday night since they say they are almost guaranteed to sell out.</li>
        <li>Friday - $189/night for a king bed or $212/night for two queens (price includes tax)</li>
        <li>Saturday - *Estimated* - $210/night for a king bed or $221-$232/night for two queens (price includes tax). These are the estimates they gave over the phone but they said that the price fluctuates so you need to call in.</li>
        <li>Call 800-320-5741 to book. Mention that the Friday night room is in the Quintana/Lynde block.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <b>Quality Inn Fishkill</b>
      <ul>
        <li>$125/night (price includes tax)</li>
        <li>Call the hotel at 845-897-9300 to book a room. Mention it's for the Lynde-Quintana wedding to get the discounted rate.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

  <h3>Why Fishkill? It's an hour from the venue!</h3>
  <div>Ya, it's a little unforunate, here's what's going on:</div>
  <ul>
    <li>There are no large hotels close to the venue. The closest is about 37 minutes away (Great Barrington, Massachusetts) but that's in the opposite direction since most people will be driving up from NJ/NY and the hotels are over $200/night.</li>
    <li>There are some large hotels a little closer (~45 minutes) but many of them are: booked up, expensive ($250-300/night) and/or and or requiring two+ night stays. In Poughkeepsie, Marist College graduation is going on that weekend and farther north, there is a huge annual horse show in the area.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Ok whatever this still sucks, I want to stay closer!</h3>
  <div>Ok calm down:
  <ul>
    <li>There are smaller, bed-and-breakfasts around the venue in Ancramdale. People are totally welcome to look into those and stay in one of them  but we won't have a shuttle to/from them. It just wasn't clear how we could have a shuttle that picked people up if they were scattered amongst a bunch of smaller places in the area. It seems like a shuttle that did that could easily take an hour to pick everyone up defeating the whole purpose of staying close.</li>
    <li>Are you sure you want to miss the pre/post-parties on the shuttles?</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
  <h3>Tentative schedule</h3>
  <div>We're still figuring out the exact schedule. To help you get a better idea of your travel plans, here's roughly what we're currently thinking:</div>
  <br />
  <div><b>Friday 5/29</b> - Meet-and-great drinks in/near Fishkill in the evening (optional).</div>
  <br />
  <div><b>Saturday 5/30</b> - Wedding starts around 3 or 4pm. Shuttle will leave Fishkill 1-1.5 hours before that.</div>
  <br />
  <div><b>Sunday 5/31</b> - Breakfast/brunch (optional).</div>
