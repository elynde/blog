    I try to get light in the morning to wake up and avoid it at night for better sleep.
    <h2 id='background'>Background</h2>

<p>A lot of people at work have asked why I have a bright light on my desk shining into my face in the morning. Seems like a reasonable thing to wonder about so I thought I&#8217;d explain a bit about the important role that light plays in our brains and what I do about that.</p>

<p>First of all, I&#8217;m a 27-year old kid who writes PHP for a living. Please don&#8217;t make any serious medical decisions based off what I&#8217;m saying.</p>

<h2 id='melatonin_and_the_daynight_cycle'>Melatonin and the day-night cycle</h2>

<p>Our bodies follow a roughly 24-hour cycle known as the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm'>circadian rhythm</a>.</p>

<p><img alt='' src='/images/bio_clock.svg.png' /></p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the tl;dr version of what&#8217;s going on:</p>

<ol>
<li>Sun sets. It&#8217;s dark outside. Eyes detect that.</li>

<li>Body responds by producing melatonin, a hormone which makes you sleepy.</li>

<li>Sleep.</li>

<li>Wake. Sun is shining. Eyes detect that.</li>

<li>Body responds by stopping melatonin production.</li>

<li>Alert and ready for the day.</li>
</ol>

<p>More info if you&#8217;re interested <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsically_photosensitive_retinal_ganglion_cells'>here</a></p>

<h2 id='winter'>Winter</h2>

<p>The duration and intensity of sunlight in the winter is dramatically less than other seasons. Couple this with the fact that most of us spend the few hours of sunlight inside working and it’s easy to become light-deprived.</p>

<p>For many of us, this is where stuff starts to go wrong. Our brains don’t shut off melatonin production because we aren’t getting enough light in the morning. We end up feeling sluggish, like you just don’t really fully wake up. It’s also common to feel depressed and just want to sleep all day due to the large amount of melatonin juicing through our bodies. Many people feel this way but many are also unaware that this is well-recognized condition known as <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_affective_disorder'>Seasonal Affective Disorder</a>.</p>

<p>Luckily, there’s also a relatively safe, cheap, well-studied treatment: light therapy or “lightboxing” as I call it. Here&#8217;s a cheesy stock photo I don&#8217;t have the copyrights for which demonstrates a SAD lamp</p>

<p><img alt='' src='/images/sad_lamp_stock_photo.jpg' /></p>

<p>Basically, shine this bright light in your face every morning for 15 - 30 minutes to get your body to think its day and stop producing melatonin. This way your body fully wakes up and you get a more defined day-night cycle and stop feeling like a zombie. I&#8217;ve been doing this for years with great results but hey, that&#8217;s not how science works so go read some studies (insert here).</p>

<p>Important note: mental health is serious. If you&#8217;re experiencing depression, don&#8217;t just start lightboxing. Go to a mental health professional. First of all, a light box isn&#8217;t a direct substitute for antidepressants, it&#8217;s a tool for this specific seasonal patter. Even if you experience SAD, antidepressants can be useful to stop the downward spiral until you&#8217;re stable enough to wane off them and try lighter approaches like lightboxing. Another thing to look out for is that sometimes lightboxe can trigger manic episodes in people with bipolar disorder. Again, if you&#8217;re depressed, go to a professional. If you are afraid/nervous/embarrassed/don&#8217;t know where to find one, feel free to reach out to me and I&#8217;ll help you find one.</p>

<p>The lightbox can be also useful if you can&#8217;t stay awake later in the day since you can use it suppress melatonin production at any time. I don&#8217;t have this problem but just an fyi.</p>

<h2 id='artificial_lighting'>Artificial lighting</h2>

<p>Just like how we&#8217;re not doing well on getting light during the day (especially during the winter) we&#8217;re also not doing well on getting <em>darkness</em> during the night.</p>

<p>Having the light on in the house might not be ideal but I&#8217;m personally not super worried about it. If the light bulbs on the ceiling aren&#8217;t powerful enough to suppress my melatonin production during the day when I want them too (so I use a much brighter lightbox to do it) then they probably aren&#8217;t doing it at night when if prefer they didn&#8217;t. I&#8217;m more worried about the glowing digital light boxes that we&#8217;re pointing directly at our face with closer and closer range - phones and computers.</p>

<p>Part of me wants to be all &#8220;don&#8217;t use electronics at night!&#8221; live like the olden days. That&#8217;s the same part of me that thinks it&#8217;d be fun to go move to a farm or live in the woods for a while. The practical side of me realizes that not using computers or phones after dark just isn&#8217;t possible. Ok maybe it&#8217;s possible but is it really the best use of my finite supply of willpower (decision fatigue article here). This is a situation that just calls for a hack.</p>

<p>On a computer, it&#8217;s easy, there&#8217;s an app called Flux which will dim your screen and remove the blue light which is what has the greatest effect on melatonin production (put info and article at top!!!). Here you can see the difference in what your screen looks like.</p>

<p>On a phone or tablet, it&#8217;s a little tougher. There&#8217;s an Android equivalent that I used for a while though it had some pretty wacky issues. On iOS, you&#8217;re screwed unless you jailbreak your phone (no thanks). I originally looked into if there were screen filters and then goggles of some sort. I eventually found these glasses on Amazon for like eight bucks which a bunch of people already use for this purpose! I&#8217;ve been using them for a while and they seem to help if I&#8217;m sitting on my phone for a long period of time at night.</p>

<p><span>image of glasses</span></p>

<h2 id='whatever_dude_i_feel_fine_with_out_all_this_nutjob_gear'>Whatever dude, I feel fine with out all this nutjob gear</h2>

<p>Everyone is different, maybe your body isn&#8217;t as affected. The lightbox is really only necessary if you experience SAD and some people can probably stare at their phone for hours and the fall asleep. Since most Americans don&#8217;t sleep enough (fact check and link), these people likely just fall asleep easily since they are probably just chronically sleep deprived.</p>

<p>Even so, the amount that we are screwing with our melatonin staring at screens is a little worrisome (breast cancer article here). It&#8217;s possible that there are other issues associated with screwing with it that we don&#8217;t know about yet.</p>

<p>I hope that gives people some good background on why I lightbox in the morning in the winter. Let me know if you have questions and I hope this information helps some of you!</p>

<p>There are several cues or <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeitgeber'>Zeitgebers</a> which our body uses to determine where in this cycle we are.</p>

<p>Note: Synthetic forms of melatonin are often taken as a sleep aid since it’s available over-the-counter, cheap and <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin#Adverse_effects'>reasonably safe</a> for short-term usage.</p>
