Month-long experiment measuring energy levels throughout the day.

## Why measure energy?

I find it hard to accomplish almost anything outside of work. It's easy to say "I don't have time" but really, even if I work long hours, it shouldn't be hard to find at least an hour every day to write, code on a side project, learn a language, etc. Even if I worked 10 hours every day (I try to work fewer than that), commuted two, worked out one, I'd still have three hours left over.

I really think that the limiting factor is energy, not time. After a long day of work, I don't have the energy to work on something else. Even during the workday, I find my energy levels fluctuate. Sometimes I'm on fire. Sometimes my brain feels like mush.

After seeing someone mention a [similar experiment on hacker news](http://madhadron.com/?p=254) I was curious to see if my fluctuations in energy were predictable. If I understood them well, I could at least plan my day better around them if not smooth out my energy to avoid crashes.

## Android app

To measure my energy, I made a [simple Android app](https://github.com/elynde/energy) that would pop up every hour, vibrate and ask me what my energy level was. To keep things simple, I just did three levels.

## Results

I didn't allow myself to look at the graphs while I ran the experiment to avoid bias. After the month, here is what I saw:

So what does this mean? I think there are a few things:
<br/>
<br/>


**I tend to crash after lunch and in the evening after work.**

This is really good to know. To smooth-out the after lunch crash, I might try to nap more often or workout then. In the least, eating a smaller lunch might help smooth out that crash. To preempt the after-work crash, I could spend my commute (on a shuttle) relaxing so I feel recharged when I get home.

**I'm definitely a night owl.**

I actually thought I wasn't too much of a night owl anymore but this experiment says otherwise.

## Conclusions

This experiment was far from perfect. For example, ideally I would have an system to passively measure my energy level. Also, I'd probably run it for a lot longer.

In the end, I don't think there is a huge takeaway from this experiment other than I have two crashes on the average day which I could

In the end, I think the main takeaways are that I have two predictable crashes on the average day I should watch out for.
* and I could don't think there is any large conclusion to draw here other than I'm going to make any dramatic life changes due to this experiment.
