    <p>Month-long experiment measuring energy levels throughout the day.</p>

<h2 id='why_measure_energy'>Why measure energy?</h2>

<p>I find it hard to accomplish almost anything outside of work. It&#8217;s easy to say &#8220;I don&#8217;t have time&#8221; but really, even if I work long hours, it shouldn&#8217;t be hard to find at least an hour every day to write, code on a side project, learn a language, etc. Even if I worked 10 hours every day (I try to work fewer than that), commuted two, worked out one, I&#8217;d still have three hours left over.</p>

<p>I really think that the limiting factor is energy, not time. After a long day of work, I don&#8217;t have the energy to work on something else. Even during the workday, I find my energy levels fluctuate. Sometimes I&#8217;m on fire. Sometimes my brain feels like mush.</p>

<p>After seeing someone mention a <a href='http://madhadron.com/?p=254'>similar experiment on hacker news</a> I was curious to see if my fluctuations in energy were predictable. If I understood them well, I could at least plan my day better around them if not smooth out my energy to avoid crashes.</p>

<h2 id='android_app'>Android app</h2>

<p>To measure my energy, I made a <a href='https://github.com/elynde/energy'>simple Android app</a> that would pop up every hour, vibrate and ask me what my energy level was. To keep things simple, I just did three levels.</p>

<h2 id='results'>Results</h2>

<p>I didn&#8217;t allow myself to look at the graphs while I ran the experiment to avoid bias. After the month, here is what I saw:</p>

<p>So what does this mean? I think there are a few things: <br /> <br /></p>

<p><strong>I tend to crash after lunch and in the evening after work.</strong></p>

<p>This is really good to know. To smooth-out the after lunch crash, I might try to nap more often or workout then. In the least, eating a smaller lunch might help smooth out that crash. To preempt the after-work crash, I could spend my commute (on a shuttle) relaxing so I feel recharged when I get home. <br /> <br /></p>

<p><strong>I&#8217;m definitely a night owl.</strong></p>

<p>I actually thought I wasn&#8217;t too much of a night owl anymore but this experiment says otherwise.</p>

<h2 id='conclusions'>Conclusions</h2>

<p>This experiment was far from perfect. For example, ideally I would have an system to passively measure my energy level. Also, I&#8217;d probably run it for a lot longer.</p>

<p>In the end, I don&#8217;t think there is a huge takeaway from this experiment other than I have two crashes on the average day which I could</p>

<p>In the end, I think the main takeaways are that I have two predictable crashes on the average day I should watch out for. * and I could don&#8217;t think there is any large conclusion to draw here other than I&#8217;m going to make any dramatic life changes due to this experiment.</p>
