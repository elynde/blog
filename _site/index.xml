          <title>Worm Composting</title>
          <description>&lt;meta name='description' content='test' /&gt;
&lt;h2 id='not_saving_the_environment'&gt;Not saving the environment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though composting is great for the environment, I mainly see this project as a fun science experiment. I also hope that maybe we&amp;#8217;ll get some good fertilizer for our plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our environmental problems run deep and I worry about personal &amp;#8220;micro-environmentalism&amp;#8221; projects lulling us into a false sense of environmental security. We&amp;#8217;re not going to just compost and carpool our way out of our problems but that&amp;#8217;s another post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;img src='../images/gore.jpg' alt='I invented the internet.' /&gt;
&lt;figcaption style='color: #aaa'&gt;
  Don't worry guys. I'm composting.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id='ok_but_about_the_environment'&gt;Ok but about the environment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok but for the sake of science, composting is pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='../images/compost_process.jpg' /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s the ;tldr on composting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic material breaking down in a landfill = methane gas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic material breaking down in a compost pile = CO₂ gas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok wait&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='../images/gore_co2.jpg' alt='I invented the internet.' /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, we&amp;#8217;re deliberately producing CO₂ which is probably the most vilified greenhouse gas. It turns out methane is worse. Way worse. &lt;a href='http://epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/gases/ch4.html'&gt;25 times&lt;/a&gt; to be exact. Sometimes it&amp;#8217;s actually captured from landfills and burnt into CO₂ to produce energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compost piles still produce a small amount of methane but much less than just dumping the garbage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='oldschool_composting'&gt;Old-school composting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided it’d be fun to try composting ourselves since NYC doesn’t do it yet. Unfortunately, we didn’t have space for a huge pile of dirt in our living room like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='../images/pile.png' /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, reading through stuff online about composting, it sounded like these piles involve a delicate &lt;a href='http://www.wikihow.com/Reduce-the-Odor-of-Composting'&gt;balancing act between nitrogen-rich and carbon-rich material&lt;/a&gt; to keep from smelling. Honestly, I didn’t trust myself to be on the hook for much more than just throwing everything in a box and forgetting about it so this probably wasn’t a good option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='i_got_worms'&gt;I got worms&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started reading more and it sounded like worm composting (sometimes called “vermicomposting”) was a better option because it is compact and low maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up getting a container from the Container Store, drilling some holes in it and throwing everything in. Then, I bought some worms from Amazon. I started out with &lt;a href='http://www.amazon.com/Uncle-Jims-Worm-Farm-Composting/dp/B00EZPSSGY'&gt;250 red wigglers&lt;/a&gt;. I would encourage you to go small here because they’ll multiply fast if they’re doing well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;img src='../images/uncle_jims_worms.jpg' alt='wormz' /&gt;
&lt;figcaption style='color: #aaa'&gt;
  You can buy basically anything on Amazon. Anything.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t a comprehensive how-to guide since there are many people online who know what they’re doing better. I made mine piecing together guides like &lt;a href='http://whatcom.wsu.edu/ag/compost/easywormbin.htm'&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; and others I found googling. From a bunch of reading, it sounds like this is what really matters when constructing it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Container should be a opaque (the worms hate light)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Drill a ton of holes in the top/sides for ventilation, the bottom for drainage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s what ours looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='../images/our_bin.jpg' alt='wormz' /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the photo, I didn’t even do the two-bin thing which means it’ll be more work to sort through later and harvest the finished compost. I may convert to two-bin at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also don’t have it lifted off the ground which is bad but it seems to be going fine. It used to be (using some cups) but the compost is very heavy at this point (probably over twenty pounds) and so I took them out (need to find something sturdier like bricks). Note: the drainage from this can be used as a powerful fertilizer known as &amp;#8220;worm tea&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These folks even make a &lt;a href='http://www.amazon.com/Worm-Factory-WF360B-Composter-Black/dp/B002LH47PY/ref=sr_1_1?s=lawn-garden&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1430589493&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=worm+bin'&gt;ready-to-go solution&lt;/a&gt;. Even though you can build this for ~$20, if you don’t have a drill and just want something you know that will work well, $100 isn’t insane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='feeding_the_guys'&gt;Feeding the guys&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of what we are feeding the worms is coffee grinds and banana peels. Maybe some occasional egg shells or avocado pits too. This is likely violating the carbon/nitrogen balance rules but we&amp;#8217;ll see how the plants feel about it. The fact the the avocado pits are continuously sprouting when I bury them here makes me think that the soil is probably reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='../images/food.jpg' alt='Food' /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One big thing that I think has probably helped keep the bin clean and not smelling is that we freeze the food before putting it in the bin. We just keep a bowl in the freezer which has worked pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='../images/freezer.jpg' alt='Food in freezer' /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tend to feed these guys in bulk. Not just because of the freezing but also so that I can bury the food a bit and/or cover it with paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='../images/paper_on_top.jpg' /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id='tips'&gt;Tips&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id='they_try_to_escape'&gt;They try to escape&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are probably just getting used to their new environment. Give them some time. I put some dirt in to start it which I think helped them settle in though it was Miracle-Gro which I later read is bad because it can burn the worms! Luckily, it didn&amp;#8217;t seem to hurt them this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also make sure that you keep it aired out and not too wet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='other_bugs'&gt;Other bugs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had some other &lt;a href='http://www.compostjunkie.com/white-worms.html'&gt;small white worms&lt;/a&gt; in our bin for a while. I was worried at first but it sounds like they aren&amp;#8217;t a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sounds like you can also get maggots which is pretty frightening. I think the freezing that we do helps kill off any eggs they might have on banana peels and such.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='no_meat_dairy'&gt;No meat, dairy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These will stink it up and cause problems like maggots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='how_its_going'&gt;How it&amp;#8217;s going&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s generally going pretty well. The worms are eating a ton. They actually even pounded a pair of old, ripped cotton boxers that I threw in (after freezing of course) which I was very impressed with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;img src='../images/hand_of_worms.jpg' alt='wormz' /&gt;
&lt;figcaption style='color: #aaa'&gt;
Happy worms live in Brooklyn.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also gave a little of the dirt to one of my plants and it seems to be doing well so I think it&amp;#8217;s going to make decent fertilizer. At least it&amp;#8217;s not like, toxic for the plant or anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, we&amp;#8217;re going to have to stop this soon because we&amp;#8217;re moving cross-country again but hopefully can start up again in California!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

Happy worming!

          <title>Light Hacking</title>
          <description>&lt;h2 id='background'&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people at work have asked why, every morning in the winter, I have a bright light on my desk shining into my face. Seems like a reasonable thing to wonder about so I thought I&amp;#8217;d explain a bit about why I lightbox and the important role that light plays in our brains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, I&amp;#8217;m a 27-year old dude who writes PHP for a living. Please don&amp;#8217;t make any serious medical decisions based off what I&amp;#8217;m saying. If you&amp;#8217;re not sleeping well, don&amp;#8217;t hesitate to go to a doctor. Bad sleep is a serious medical issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='melatonin_and_the_daynight_cycle'&gt;Melatonin and the day-night cycle&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our bodies follow a roughly 24-hour cycle known as the &lt;a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm'&gt;circadian rhythm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src='/images/bio_clock.svg.png' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s the tl;dr version of what&amp;#8217;s going on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sun sets. It&amp;#8217;s dark outside. &lt;a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsically_photosensitive_retinal_ganglion_cells'&gt;Eyes&lt;/a&gt; detect that.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Body responds by producing &lt;a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin'&gt;melatonin&lt;/a&gt;, a hormone which makes you sleepy.*&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Sleep.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Wake. Sun is shining. Eyes detect that.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Body responds by stopping melatonin production so you aren&amp;#8217;t sleepy anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* = this is the current thinking but it&amp;#8217;s actually not 100% certain. Scientists are still learning about the role of melatonin in the body. Also worth noting: synthetic forms of melatonin are often taken as a sleep aid since it’s available over-the-counter, cheap and &lt;a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin#Adverse_effects'&gt;reasonably safe&lt;/a&gt; for short-term usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Light is actually only one of several cues or &lt;a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeitgeber'&gt;Zeitgebers&lt;/a&gt; which our body uses to determine where in this cycle we are but it appears to be the strongest one we know about. Another common one is eating/not eating which you&amp;#8217;ve probably heard of people trying as a jetlag avoidance strategy. It&amp;#8217;s unclear how effective that strategy is but probably less effective than controlling light exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='sad_in_the_winter'&gt;SAD in the winter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the winter, there is dramatically less daylight than other seasons. Couple this with the fact that most of us spend the few hours of sunlight inside working and our brains might not get a strong enough &amp;#8220;it&amp;#8217;s daytime&amp;#8221; signal due to the lack of light. Therefore, our bodies keep producing melatonin and we end up feeling sluggish. It’s also common to feel depressed and just want to sleep all day due to the large amount of melatonin juicing through our bodies. This is actually a well-recognized condition known as &lt;a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_affective_disorder'&gt;Seasonal Affective Disorder&lt;/a&gt; or &amp;#8220;SAD&amp;#8221; for short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, there’s also a relatively safe, cheap, well-studied treatment: light therapy or “lightboxing” as I call it. This is what it looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src='/images/lightbox_at_work.jpg' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s how it works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shine this light in your face every morning for 30 minutes or so.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Make sure it&amp;#8217;s within about two feet or so of your face&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Your body will catch on, stop thinking it&amp;#8217;s night and stop producing melatonin.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Blue light might be more effective than white light but there have been some questions about safety so I&amp;#8217;m just holding off on it. More on blue light later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Important note: mental health is serious. If you&amp;#8217;re experiencing depression, don&amp;#8217;t just start lightboxing. Go to a mental health professional. First of all, a light box isn&amp;#8217;t a direct substitute for antidepressants, it&amp;#8217;s a tool for this specific seasonal pattern. Even if you experience SAD, antidepressants can be useful to stop the downward spiral until you&amp;#8217;re stable enough to wane off them and try lighter approaches like lightboxing. Another thing to look out for is that sometimes lightbox can trigger manic episodes in people with bipolar disorder. Again, if you&amp;#8217;re depressed, go to a professional. If you are afraid/nervous/embarrassed/don&amp;#8217;t know where to find one, feel free to reach out to me and I&amp;#8217;ll help you find one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lightbox can be also useful if you can&amp;#8217;t stay awake later in the day since you can use it suppress melatonin production at any time. I don&amp;#8217;t usually have this problem (unless jetlagged) but just an fyi in case you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='artificial_lighting'&gt;Artificial lighting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like how we&amp;#8217;re not doing well on getting light during the day (especially during the winter) we&amp;#8217;re also not doing well on getting &lt;em&gt;darkness&lt;/em&gt; during the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having the light on in the house might not be ideal but I&amp;#8217;m personally not super worried about it. If the light bulbs on the ceiling aren&amp;#8217;t powerful enough to suppress my melatonin production during the day when I want them to, then I figure they probably aren&amp;#8217;t doing it at night either. I&amp;#8217;m more worried about the glowing digital light boxes that we&amp;#8217;re pointing directly at our face with closer and closer range - phones and computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of me wants to be all &amp;#8220;don&amp;#8217;t use electronics at night!&amp;#8221; live like the olden days. That&amp;#8217;s the same part of me that thinks it&amp;#8217;d be fun to go move to a farm or live in the woods for a while. The practical side of me realizes that not using computers or phones after dark just isn&amp;#8217;t possible. Ok maybe it&amp;#8217;s possible but is it really the best use of my finite supply of willpower (go read about decision fatigue). This is a situation that just calls for a hack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a computer, it&amp;#8217;s easy, there&amp;#8217;s an app called &lt;a href='https://justgetflux.com'&gt;Flux&lt;/a&gt; which will dim your screen and remove the &lt;a href='https://justgetflux.com/research.html'&gt;blue light&lt;/a&gt; which is what has the greatest effect on melatonin production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a phone or tablet, it&amp;#8217;s a little tougher. There&amp;#8217;s an Android equivalent that I used for a while though it had some pretty wacky issues. On iOS, you&amp;#8217;re screwed unless you jailbreak your phone (no thanks). I originally looked into if there were screen filters and then goggles of some sort. I eventually found these &lt;a href='http://www.amazon.com/Uvex-S1933X-Eyewear-SCT-Orange-Anti-Fog/dp/B000USRG90'&gt;glasses&lt;/a&gt; on Amazon for like eight bucks which a bunch of people already use for this purpose! I&amp;#8217;ve been using them for a while and they seem to help if I&amp;#8217;m sitting on my phone for a long period of time at night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src='/images/me_amber_glasses.jpg' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='whatever_dude_i_feel_fine_with_out_all_this_nutjob_gear'&gt;Whatever dude, I feel fine with out all this nutjob gear&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone is different, maybe your body isn&amp;#8217;t as affected. I wrote this up because people at work ask about the lightbox a bunch and because I&amp;#8217;m a huge fan of sleep and am always evangelizing it (it&amp;#8217;s amazing try it some time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lightbox is really only necessary if you experience SAD and some people can probably stare at their phone for hours and the fall asleep. Since many people &lt;a href='http://www.cdc.gov/features/dssleep/'&gt;don&amp;#8217;t sleep enough&lt;/a&gt;, you might fall asleep easily because you&amp;#8217;re just chronically sleep deprived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, the amount that we are screwing with our melatonin staring at screens is a &lt;a href='http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/280194.php'&gt;little worrisome&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s possible that there are risks we don&amp;#8217;t know about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that gives people some good background on why I lightbox in the morning in the winter. Let me know if you have questions and I hope this information helps some of you!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <title>California's Hidden Gems</title>
          <description>&lt;h2 id='leaving_california'&gt;Leaving California&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fall, I&amp;#8217;ll be packing up and leaving California to move to New York. I had a great few years here filled with many fun weekend trips. If you love nature, California really is all that it&amp;#8217;s cracked up to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I think back on some of the great places, I can remember several that not many people I know had visited. So, here&amp;#8217;s my parting gift to all you California weekend explorers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='paso_robles_central_coast'&gt;Paso Robles (Central Coast)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beautiful, laid-back wine country. Much more down-to-earth and affordable than Napa. Often, you can even meet and chat with the winemakers themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paso Robles is starting to become well-known in the wine world for their high-quality reds (not many whites are made there) but the area hasn&amp;#8217;t become saturated with tourists like Napa and Sonoma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src='/images/paso.jpg' alt='The rolling hills of Paso Robles' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you check out one of my favorite restaurants: the taco stand outside &lt;a href='http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-reyna-market-paso-robles'&gt;La Reyna Mexican Market&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='channel_islands_near_santa_barbara'&gt;Channel Islands (Near Santa Barbara)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;What are those islands off the coast?&amp;#8221; - Melody while looking at a map of California&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out, they&amp;#8217;re a National Park with an interesting history. Isolated from the mainland for thousands of years, the Channel Islands are often referred to as &amp;#8220;Galapagos Islands of North America.&amp;#8221; There are a couple of animals here that aren&amp;#8217;t found anywhere else in the world such as the Island Fox. In case you weren&amp;#8217;t aware, &lt;a href='https://www.facebook.com/MPKFOX'&gt;foxes are super cute.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src='/images/island_fox.jpg' alt='Island Fox' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t miss the cave kayaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src='/images/kayaking.jpg' alt='Cave Kayaking' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best parts about visiting the Channel Islands is the ferry ride out and back. You&amp;#8217;ll likely see Sea Lions and, if you get as lucky as we did, a Humpback Whale!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re into roughing it a bit, opt to camp overnight instead of taking the afternoon ferry back. Though the island we visited (Santa Cruz Island) is supposedly the most touristy of the Channel Islands, few seem to camp and so we were left with our own, semi-private island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src='/images/channel_islands.jpg' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='murphys_and_sonora_near_yosemite'&gt;Murphys and Sonora (near Yosemite)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a great area to escape and relax for a weekend. Great food, wine and some gold rush history including the historic route 49 and the world&amp;#8217;s largest gold nugget. Also stop by Calaveras Big Trees State Park to, well, see some big trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src='/images/big_trees.jpg' alt='A big tree' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='panther_beach_near_santa_cruz'&gt;Panther Beach (Near Santa Cruz)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 10 miles north of Santa Cruz lies the stunning Panther Beach. Though not exactly &amp;#8220;secret&amp;#8221; most haven&amp;#8217;t heard of it and knowledge of it is generally passed on by a friend who knows about it taking you there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have the time, take the Highway 1 down from San Francisco or Half Moon Bay and stop at some of the farm stands/shops for some fresh food. Also, check and see if &lt;a href='http://freewheelinfarm.com/'&gt;these folks&lt;/a&gt; are having a harvest party. Some dude selling dates at the Menlo Park Farmer&amp;#8217;s Market told us about it and we went on a whim. Ended up being an awesome time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src='/images/panther.jpg' alt='Hiking down to Panther Beach' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src='/images/panther2.jpg' alt='The beach' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='onward'&gt;Onward&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just the tip of the iceberg. There are tons of cool places I never made it to and probably even more I didn&amp;#8217;t know existed. If you&amp;#8217;re lucky enough to live in California, make sure you spend some time exploring. You definitely won&amp;#8217;t regret it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <title>Traveling Ultralight</title>
          <description>&lt;h2 id='weighed_down'&gt;Weighed down&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, a large part of the fun in international travel is the feeling of exploration in navigating my way around. Though this exploration can be fun, walking around a city for an hour trying to find a hostel with vacancy or the bus station that isn&amp;#8217;t on the map can get tiring and really put a damper on your trip, even with a good backpacking pack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Costa Rica 2008 (pre-ultralight and pre-UV water sterilizer):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src='/images/costa_rica_backpack.jpg' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='you_should_just_bring_a_backpack'&gt;&amp;#8220;You should just bring a backpack&amp;#8221;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trip to India was pretty last-minute. Basically, work asked if anyone wanted to go with about a week and a half notice. A couple of nights before I left, my team was out for dinner and they started asking me about the trip. I told them I always feel like I have too much stuff while traveling and that I wanted to pack lighter this time around. One of my coworkers said out of the blue &amp;#8220;you should just bring a backpack.&amp;#8221; I thought that was pretty crazy but he was insistent that it was a good idea so I gave it a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='packing'&gt;Packing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dropped all assumptions and questioned every item I packed. It&amp;#8217;s easy to justify any item by asking &amp;#8220;would this come in handy?&amp;#8221; (most things could). The question to ask is &lt;strong&gt;what would happen if I forgot this?&lt;/strong&gt; and then only pack the items that you would be screwed without.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything I packed (not including the shirt, pants, boxers, socks I had on while taking the photo):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src='/images/india_backpack_contents.jpg' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='notable_inclusions'&gt;Notable inclusions:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.amazon.com/ExOfficio-Mens-Give-N-Go-Boxer-Brief/dp/B001M0MN16'&gt;ExOfficio Give-N-Go boxers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These lightweight, breathable underwear are simply amazing and a must-have for any ultralight traveller. Their Aegis® Microbe Shield™ allows you to wear them for days without washing them. Their slogan is actually &lt;a href='http://www.exofficio.com/products/details/mens-give-n-go-boxer'&gt;&amp;#8220;17 countries. 6 weeks. One pair of award-winning underwear. (Ok, maybe two.)&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;. That&amp;#8217;s stretching it a bit in my opinion. I washed them in a hotel sink every couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Running shorts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pair of long-ish running shorts are really versatile. Other than using them for running, yoga, hiking or other exercise they can be used as a swimsuit since they are basically the same thing (shorts with a liner).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.amazon.com/MSR-PACKTOWLORIGINAL-Packtowl-Original/dp/B001QWGW6M'&gt;MSR Packtowel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small but incredibly absorbent towel that dries scary quick. Also, hotels or hostels often will lend you a towel. Using that is advantageous because you don&amp;#8217;t have to worry about packing it wet if you leave soon after using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.amazon.com/Smartwool-Outdoor-Light-Mini-Socks/dp/B008K7GX38/ref=sr_1_41?s=sporting-goods&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1357279705&amp;amp;sr=1-41'&gt;Smartwool Socks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, these are the only socks I wear. My feet feel cool in hot weather and warm in cold weather. You can wear them for days without them smelling bad. They are easy to wash in a hotel sink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.amazon.com/SteriPen-SteriPEN-Adventurer-Opti/dp/B0095MOGEK/ref=pd_sbs_a_5'&gt;Steripen UV Water Purifier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drinking the tap water in India is inadvisable for foreigners. Not only are plastic bottles terrible for the environment (&lt;a href='http://www.treehugger.com/clean-technology/why-recycling-plastic-bottles-doesnt-help-the-problem-video.html'&gt;even when recycled&lt;/a&gt;), you also have to watch out for scams where bottled water is just tap water. I opt to just carry around this small UV light which allows me to fill up with tap water and sterilize it in 90 seconds. This is especially useful in remote areas where you might not have access to bottled water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.rei.com/product/784060/rei-adventures-pants-mens-32-inseam'&gt;REI Adventure Pants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lightweight, breathable and quick-drying. I brought two pairs so I could wear one while the other was airing out or drying after a wash. You really don&amp;#8217;t need more than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.rei.com/product/794446/rei-sahara-tech-long-sleeve-shirt-mens'&gt;REI Sahara Shirt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same idea as the pants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='noteable_exclusions'&gt;Noteable exclusions:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.amazon.com/Lonely-Planet-India-Country-Travel/dp/1741797802'&gt;Lonely Planet India&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book is 1,200 pages. Even the &lt;a href='http://www.amazon.com/Lonely-Planet-Kerala-Regional-Travel/dp/1741797810'&gt;South India &amp;amp; Kerala&lt;/a&gt; book (where I traveled mostly) is over 500. Though it was definitely worse for maps and just general browsing, I used the &lt;a href='http://www.amazon.com/India-Travel-Guide-Country-ebook/dp/B005GYGCOI/ref=tmm_kin_title_0'&gt;Kindle edition&lt;/a&gt;. It was worth the trade-off to save weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shoes other than hiking boots&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only wore hiking boots which was fine because the SmartWool socks helped me stay cool. Shoes are just too heavy and voluminous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raincoat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Didn&amp;#8217;t hit much rain. Plan was to just buy a cheap one if I needed it and then donate it. This is the perfect example of something that could easily be justified as useful but you wouldn&amp;#8217;t be screwed without.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='freedom'&gt;Freedom&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Myspace shot of the final result:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src='/images/india_myspace.jpg' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traveling ultralight was quite a liberating experience. Whether I was running to catch a bus or making an impromptu beach trip, being able to easily carry everything on my back helped me have a trip that was simultaneously more adventurous and less stressful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <title>Energy Experiment</title>
          <description>&lt;h2 id='why_measure_my_energy'&gt;Why measure my energy?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find it hard to accomplish almost anything outside of work. It&amp;#8217;s easy to say &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t have time&amp;#8221; but really, even if I work long hours, it shouldn&amp;#8217;t be hard to find at least an hour every day to write, code on a side project, learn a language, etc. Even if I worked 10 hours every day (I try to work fewer than that), commuted two, worked out one and slept eight, I&amp;#8217;d still have three hours left over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really think that the limiting factor is energy, not time. After a long day of work, I don&amp;#8217;t have the energy to work on something else. Even during the workday, my energy seems to fluctuate. Sometimes I&amp;#8217;m on fire. Sometimes my brain feels like mush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After seeing someone mention a &lt;a href='http://madhadron.com/?p=254'&gt;similar experiment on Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; I was curious to see if my fluctuations in energy were predictable. If I understood them well, I could at least plan my day better around them if not smooth out my energy to avoid crashes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='how_i_did_it'&gt;How I did it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To measure my energy, I made a &lt;a href='https://github.com/elynde/energy'&gt;simple Android app&lt;/a&gt; that would pop up every hour, vibrate and ask me what my energy level was. To keep things simple, I just did three levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src='/images/log.png' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, I would have a system for passively measuring my energy level to eliminate any bias I might add but I couldn&amp;#8217;t think of anything feasible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='what_i_learned'&gt;What I learned&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#8217;t allow myself to look at the graphs while I ran the experiment to avoid bias. After the month, here is what I saw:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src='/images/results.png' class='max_width_100_percent' /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does this mean? I think there are a few things: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I tend to crash after lunch and in the evening after work.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is really good to know. To smooth-out the after lunch crash, I might try to nap more often or workout then. In the least, eating a smaller lunch might help smooth out that crash. To preempt the after-work crash, I could spend my commute (on a shuttle) relaxing so I feel recharged when I get home. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#8217;m a night owl.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually thought I wasn&amp;#8217;t too much of a night owl anymore but this experiment says otherwise. As you can see in the graph, my energy levels are pretty high at night. Maybe I&amp;#8217;ll experiment with trying to change this in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
